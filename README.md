# python-dog-vs-cat
CNN and DNN to classify dog and cats pictures

I made this project in order to discover Tensorflow library. I could code Deep Neural Network from scratch quite easily. The design of the network can be changed when we declare it. Still, the prediction rate for cat and dogs qualification remains very low (around 65%) with this kind of network. This is why I'd like to train a convolutional neural network to compare its performance.
The convolutional Neural Network is copied from this great tutorial and is waiting for my personal improvements (dropout, learning rate decay, ...).
